API Changes
***********

Changes in this release
=======================

* Zephyr now requires Python 3.8 or higher

* Changed :c:struct:`spi_cs_control` to remove anonymous struct.
  This causes possible breakage for static initialization of the
  struct.  Updated :c:macro:`SPI_CS_CONTROL_PTR_DT` to reflect
  this change.

* The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_LEGACY_INCLUDE_PATH` option has been disabled by
  default, all upstream code and modules have been converted to use
  ``<zephyr/...>`` header paths. The option is still available to facilitate
  the migration of external applications, but will be removed with the 3.4
  release.  The :zephyr_file:`scripts/utils/migrate_includes.py` script is
  provided to automate the migration.

* :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/zephyr.h` no longer defines ``__ZEPHYR__``.
  This definition can be used by third-party code to compile code conditional
  to Zephyr. The definition is already injected by the Zephyr build system.
  Therefore, any third-party code integrated using the Zephyr build system will
  require no changes. External build systems will need to inject the definition
  by themselves, if they did not already.

* :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/zephyr.h` has been deprecated in favor of
  :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/kernel.h`, since it only included that header. No
  changes are required by applications other than replacing ``#include
  <zephyr/zephyr.h>`` with ``#include <zephyr/kernel.h>``.

* Bluetooth: Applications where :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BT_EATT` is enabled
  must set the :c:member:`chan_opt` field on the GATT parameter structs.
  To keep the old behavior use :c:enumerator:`BT_ATT_CHAN_OPT_NONE`.

* CAN

  * The Zephyr SocketCAN definitions have been moved from :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/drivers/can.h`
    to :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/net/socketcan.h`, the SocketCAN ``struct can_frame`` has been
    renamed to :c:struct:`socketcan_frame`, and the SocketCAN ``struct can_filter`` has been renamed
    to :c:struct:`socketcan_filter`. The SocketCAN utility functions are now available in
    :zephyr_file:`include/zephyr/net/socketcan_utils.h`.

  * The CAN controller ``struct zcan_frame`` has been renamed to :c:struct:`can_frame`, and ``struct
    zcan_filter`` has been renamed to :c:struct:`can_filter`.

  * The :c:enum:`can_state` enumerations have been renamed to contain the word STATE in order to make
    their context more clear:

    * ``CAN_ERROR_ACTIVE`` renamed to :c:enumerator:`CAN_STATE_ERROR_ACTIVE`.
    * ``CAN_ERROR_WARNING`` renamed to :c:enumerator:`CAN_STATE_ERROR_WARNING`.
    * ``CAN_ERROR_PASSIVE`` renamed to :c:enumerator:`CAN_STATE_ERROR_PASSIVE`.
    * ``CAN_BUS_OFF`` renamed to :c:enumerator:`CAN_STATE_BUS_OFF`.

  * The error code for :c:func:`can_send` when the CAN controller is in bus off state has been
    changed from ``-ENETDOWN`` to ``-ENETUNREACH``. A return value of ``-ENETDOWN`` now indicates
    that the CAN controller is in :c:enumerator:`CAN_STATE_STOPPED`.

  * The list of valid return values for the CAN timing calculation functions have been expanded to
    allow distinguishing between an out of range bitrate/sample point, an unsupported bitrate, and a
    resulting sample point outside the guard limit.

* Memory Management Drivers

  * Added :c:func:`sys_mm_drv_update_page_flags` and
    :c:func:`sys_mm_drv_update_region_flags` to update flags associated
    with memory pages and regions.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* The following functions, macros, and structures related to the
  deprecated kernel work queue API have been removed:

  * ``k_work_pending()``
  * ``k_work_q_start()``
  * ``k_delayed_work``
  * ``k_delayed_work_init()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_submit_to_queue()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_submit()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_pending()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_cancel()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_remaining_get()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_expires_ticks()``
  * ``k_delayed_work_remaining_ticks()``
  * ``K_DELAYED_WORK_DEFINE``

* Removed support for enabling passthrough mode on MPU9150 to
  AK8975 sensor.

* Removed deprecated SPI :c:struct:`spi_cs_control` fields for GPIO management
  that have been replaced with :c:struct:`gpio_dt_spec`.

* Removed support for configuring the CAN-FD maximum DLC value via Kconfig
  ``CONFIG_CANFD_MAX_DLC``.

* Removed deprecated civetweb module and the associated support code and samples.

Deprecated in this release
==========================

  in favor of utilizing :c:macro:`DT_BUS` and variants.

* STM32 LPTIM domain clock should now be configured using devicetree.
  Related Kconfig :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_STM32_LPTIM_CLOCK` option is now
  deprecated.

* ``label`` property from devicetree as a base property. The property is still
  valid for specific bindings to specify like :dtcompatible:`gpio-leds` and
  :dtcompatible:`fixed-partitions`.

* Bluetooth mesh Configuration Client API prefixed with ``bt_mesh_cfg_``
  is deprecated in favor of a new API with prefix ``bt_mesh_cfg_cli_``.

* Pinmux API is now officially deprecated in favor of the pin control API.
  Its removal is scheduled for the 3.4 release. Refer to :ref:`pinctrl-guide`
  for more details on pin control.

    Otherwise no significant changes.

Devicetree
**********

* Use of the devicetree *label property* has been deprecated, and the property
  has been made optional in almost all bindings throughout the tree.

  In previous versions of zephyr, label properties like this commonly appeared
  in devicetree files:

  .. code-block:: dts

     foo {
             label = "FOO";
             /* ... */
     };

  You could then use something like the following to retrieve a device
  structure for use in the :ref:`device_model_api`:

  .. code-block:: c

     const struct device *my_dev = device_get_binding("FOO");
     if (my_dev == NULL) {
             /* either device initialization failed, or no such device */
     } else {
             /* device is ready for use */
     }

  This approach has multiple problems.

  First, it incurs a runtime string comparison over all devices in the system
  to look up each device, which is inefficient since devices are statically
  allocated and known at build time. Second, missing devices due to
  misconfigured device drivers could not easily be distinguished from device
  initialization failures, since both produced ``NULL`` return values from
  ``device_get_binding()``. This led to frequent confusion. Third, the
  distinction between the label property and devicetree *node labels* -- which
  are different despite the similar terms -- was a frequent source of user
  confusion, especially since either one can be used to retrieve device
  structures.

  Instead of using label properties, you should now generally be using node
  labels to retrieve devices instead. Node labels look like the ``lbl`` token
  in the following devicetree:

  .. code-block:: dts

     lbl: foo {
             /* ... */
     };

  and you can retrieve the device structure pointer like this:

  .. code-block:: c

     /* If the next line causes a build error, then there
      * is no such device. Either fix your devicetree or make sure your
      * device driver is allocating a device. */
     const struct device *my_dev = DEVICE_DT_GET(DT_NODELABEL(lbl));

     if (!device_is_ready(my_dev)) {
             /* device exists, but it failed to initialize */
     } else {
             /* device is ready for use */
     }

  As shown in the above snippet, :c:macro:`DEVICE_DT_GET` should generally be
  used instead of ``device_get_binding()`` when getting device structures from
  devicetree nodes. Note that you can pass ``DEVICE_DT_GET`` any devicetree
  :ref:`node identifier <dt-node-identifiers>` -- you don't have to use
  :c:macro:`DT_NODELABEL`, though it is usually convenient to do so.

* Support for devicetree "fixups" was removed. For more details, see `commit
  b2520b09a7
  <https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/commit/b2520b09a78b86b982a659805e0c65b34e3112a5>`_

* :ref:`devicetree_api`

  * All devicetree macros now recursively expand their arguments. This means
    that in the following example, ``INDEX`` is always replaced with the number
    ``3`` for any hypothetical devicetree macro ``DT_FOO()``:

    .. code-block:: c

       #define INDEX 3
       int foo = DT_FOO(..., INDEX)

    Previously, devicetree macro arguments were expanded or not on a
    case-by-case basis. The current behavior ensures you can always rely on
    macro expansion when using devicetree APIs.

  * New API macros:

     * :c:macro:`DT_FIXED_PARTITION_EXISTS`
     * :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_CHILD_SEP_VARGS`
     * :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_CHILD_SEP`
     * :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_CHILD_STATUS_OKAY_SEP_VARGS`
     * :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_CHILD_STATUS_OKAY_SEP`
     * :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_NODE`
     * :c:macro:`DT_FOREACH_STATUS_OKAY_NODE`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_CHILD`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD_SEP_VARGS`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD_SEP`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD_STATUS_OKAY_SEP_VARGS`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD_STATUS_OKAY_SEP`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD_STATUS_OKAY_VARGS`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_FOREACH_CHILD_STATUS_OKAY`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_STRING_TOKEN_BY_IDX`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_STRING_TOKEN`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_STRING_UPPER_TOKEN_BY_IDX`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_STRING_UPPER_TOKEN_OR`
     * :c:macro:`DT_INST_STRING_UPPER_TOKEN`
     * :c:macro:`DT_NODE_VENDOR_BY_IDX_OR`
     * :c:macro:`DT_NODE_VENDOR_BY_IDX`
     * :c:macro:`DT_NODE_VENDOR_HAS_IDX`
     * :c:macro:`DT_NODE_VENDOR_OR`
     * :c:macro:`DT_STRING_TOKEN_BY_IDX`
     * :c:macro:`DT_STRING_UPPER_TOKEN_BY_IDX`
     * :c:macro:`DT_STRING_UPPER_TOKEN_OR`

  * Deprecated macros:

     * ``DT_LABEL(node_id)``: use ``DT_PROP(node_id, label)`` instead. This is
       part of the general deprecation of the label property described at the
       top of this section.
     * ``DT_INST_LABEL(inst)``: use ``DT_INST_PROP(inst, label)`` instead
     * ``DT_BUS_LABEL(node_id)``: use ``DT_PROP(DT_BUS(node_id), label))`` instead
     * ``DT_INST_BUS_LABEL(node_id)``: use ```DT_PROP(DT_INST_BUS(inst),
       label)`` instead. Similar advice applies for the rest of the following
       deprecated macros: if you need to access a devicetree node's label
       property, do so explicitly using another property access API macro.
     * ``DT_GPIO_LABEL_BY_IDX()``
     * ``DT_GPIO_LABEL()``
     * ``DT_INST_GPIO_LABEL_BY_IDX()``
     * ``DT_INST_GPIO_LABEL()``
     * ``DT_SPI_DEV_CS_GPIOS_LABEL()``
     * ``DT_INST_SPI_DEV_CS_GPIOS_LABEL()``
     * ``DT_CHOSEN_ZEPHYR_FLASH_CONTROLLER_LABEL``

* Bindings

  * The :ref:`bus <dt-bindings-bus>` key in a bindings file can now be a list
    of strings as well as a string. This allows a single node to declare that
    it represents hardware which can communicate over multiple bus protocols.
    The primary use case is simultaneous support for I3C and I2C buses in the
    same nodes, with the base bus definition provided in
    :zephyr_file:`dts/bindings/i3c/i3c-controller.yaml`.

Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Console

* C Library

  * Added Picolibc as a Zephyr module. Picolibc module is a footprint-optimized
    full C standard library implementation that is configurable at the build
    time.
  * C library heap initialization call has been moved from the ``APPLICATION``
    phase to the ``POST_KERNEL`` phase to allow calling the libc dynamic memory
    management functions (e.g. ``malloc()``) during the application
    initialization phase.
  * Added ``strerror()`` and ``strerror_r()`` functions to the minimal libc.
  * Removed architecture-specific ``off_t`` type definition in the minimal
    libc. ``off_t`` is now defined as ``intptr_t`` regardless of the selected
    architecture.

* C++ Subsystem

  * Added ``std::ptrdiff_t``, ``std::size_t``, ``std::max_align_t`` and
    ``std::nullptr_t`` type definitions to the C++ subsystem ``cstddef``
    header.
  * Renamed global constructor list symbols to prevent the native POSIX host
    runtime from executing the constructors before Zephyr loads.

* Cbprintf

  * Updated cbprintf static packaging to interpret ``unsigned char *`` as a pointer
    to a string. See :ref:`cbprintf_packaging_limitations` for more details about
    how to efficienty use strings. Change mainly applies to the ``logging`` subsystem
    since it uses this feature.

* Emul

  * Added :c:macro:`EMUL_DT_DEFINE` and :c:macro:`EMUL_DT_INST_DEFINE` to mirror
    :c:macro:`DEVICE_DT_DEFINE` and :c:macro:`DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE` respectively.
  * Added :c:macro:`EMUL_DT_GET` to mirror :c:macro:`DEVICE_DT_GET`.
  * Removed the need to manually register emulators in their init function (automatically done).

* Filesystem

  * Added cash used to reduce the NVS data lookup time, see
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NVS_LOOKUP_CACHE` option.
  * Changing mkfs options to create FAT32 on larger storage when FAT16 fails.

* IPC

* Management

  * MCUMGR race condition when using the task status function whereby if a
    thread state changed it could give a falsely short process list has been
    fixed.
  * MCUMGR shell (group 9) CBOR structure has changed, the ``rc``
    response is now only used for mcumgr errors, shell command
    execution result codes are instead returned in the ``ret``
    variable instead, see :ref:`mcumgr_smp_group_9` for updated
    information. Legacy bahaviour can be restored by enabling
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_MCUMGR_CMD_SHELL_MGMT_LEGACY_RC_RETURN_CODE`
  * MCUMGR img_mgmt erase command now accepts an optional slot number
    to select which image will be erased, using the ``slot`` input
    (will default to slot 1 if not provided).
  * MCUMGR :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_OS_MGMT_TASKSTAT_SIGNED_PRIORITY` is now
    enabled by default, this makes thread priorities in the taskstat command
    signed, which matches the signed priority of tasks in Zephyr, to revert
    to previous behaviour of using unsigned values, disable this Kconfig.
  * MCUMGR taskstat runtime field support has been added, if
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_OS_MGMT_TASKSTAT` is enabled, which will report the
    number of CPU cycles have been spent executing the thread.
  * MCUMGR transport API drops ``zst`` parameter, of :c:struct:`zephyr_smp_transport`
    type, from :c:func:`zephyr_smp_transport_out_fn` type callback as it has
    not been used, and the ``nb`` parameter, of :c:struct:`net_buf` type,
    can carry additional transport information when needed.
  * A dummy SMP transport has been added which allows for testing MCUMGR
    functionality and commands/responses.
  * An issue with the UART/shell transports whereby large packets would wrongly
    be split up with multiple start-of-frame headers instead of only one has been
    fixed.
  * SMP now runs in its own dedicated work queue which prevents issues running in
    the system workqueue with some transports, e.g. Bluetooth, which previously
    caused a deadlock if buffers could not be allocated.
  * Bluetooth transport will now reduce the size of packets that are sent if they
    are too large for the remote device instead of failing to send them, if the
    remote device cannot accept a notification of 20 bytes then the attempt is
    aborted.
  * Unaligned memory access problems for CPUs that do not support it in MCUMGR
    headers has been fixed.
  * Groups in MCUMGR now use kernel slist entries rather than the custom MCUMGR
    structs for storage.
  * Levels of function redirection which were previously used to support multiple
    OS's have been reduced to simplify code and reduce output size.
  * Bluetooth SMP debug output format specifier has been fixed to avoid a build
    warning on native_posix platforms.
  * Issue with :c:func:`img_mgmt_dfu_stopped` being wrongly called on success
    has been fixed.
  * Issue with MCUMGR img_mgmt image erase wrongly returning success during an
    error condition has been fixed.
  * Unused MCUMGR header files such as mcumgr_util.h have been removed.
  * Verbose error response reporting has been fixed and is now present when
    enabled.
  * Internal SMP functions have been removed from the public smp.h header file
    and moved to smp_internal.h
  * Kconfig files have been split up and moved to directories containing the
    systems they influence.
  * MCUMGR img_mgmt image upload over-riding/hiding of result codes has been
    fixed.

* Logging

  * Removed legacy (v1) implementation and removed any references to the logging
    v2.
  * Added :c:macro:`LOG_RAW` for logging strings without additional formatting.
    It is similar to :c:macro:`LOG_PRINTK` but do not append ``<cr>`` when new line is found.
  * Improvements in the ADSP backend.
  * File system backend: Only delete old files if necessary.

* IPC

  * Introduced a 'zephyr,buffer-size' DT property to set the sizes for TX and
    RX buffers per created instance.
  * Set WQ priority back to PRIO_PREEMPT to fix an issue that was starving the scheduler.
  * ``icmsg_buf`` library was renamed to ``spsc_pbuf``.
  * Added cache handling support to ``spsc_pbuf``.
  * Fixed an issue where the TX virtqueue was misaligned by 2 bytes due to the
    way the virtqueue start address is calculated
  * Added :c:func:`ipc_service_deregister_endpoint` function to deregister endpoints.

* LoRaWAN

  * Added Class-C support.
  * Upgraded the loramac-node repository to v4.6.0.
  * Moved the ``REQUIRES_FULL_LIBC`` library dependency from LoRa to LoRaWAN.
  * Fixed the async reception in SX127x modems.

* Modbus

  * Added user data entry for ADU callback

* Power management

  * Allow multiple subscribers to latency changes in the policy manager.
  * Added new API to implement suspend-to-RAM (S2RAM). Select
    :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_PM_S2RAM` to enable this feature.
  * Added :c:func:`pm_device_is_powered` to query a device power state.

* POSIX

  * Make ``tz`` non-const in ``gettimeofday()`` for conformance to spec.
  * Fix pthread descriptor resource leak. Previously only pthreads with state
    ``PTHREAD_TERMINATED`` could be reused. However, ``pthread_join()`` sets
    the state to ``PTHREAD_EXITED``. Consider both states as candidates in
    ``pthread_create()``.
  * Add ``perror()`` implementation
  * Use consistent timebase in ``sem_timedwait()``

* RTIO

  * Initial version of an asynchronous task and executor API for I/O similar inspired
    by Linux's very successful io_uring.
  * Provides a simple linear and limited concurrency executor, simple task queuing,
    and the ability to poll for task completions.

* SD Subsystem

  * SDMMC STM32: Now compatible with STM32L5 series. Added DMA support for DMA-V1
    compatible devices.
  * Added support for handling the :c:macro:`DISK_IOCTL_CTRL_SYNC` ioctl call.
    this enables the filesystem api :c:func:`fs_sync`.

* Settings

  * Added API function :c:func:`settings_storage_get` which allows to get
    the storage instance used by the settings backed to store its records.

* Shell

* Storage

* Testsuite

  * Added Kconfig support to ``unit_testing`` platform.
  * Migrate tests to use :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ZTEST_NEW_API`
  * Add ztest options for shuffling tests/suites via:

    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ZTEST_SHUFFLE`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ZTEST_SHUFFLE_SUITE_REPEAT_COUNT`
    * :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_ZTEST_SHUFFLE_TEST_REPEAT_COUNT`

  * Add ztest native_posix command line arguments for running specific tests/suites using
    ``--test suite_name:*`` or ``--test suite_name::test_name`` command line arguments.
